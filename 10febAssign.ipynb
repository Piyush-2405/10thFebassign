    "The close() function is used to close a file object in Python. It is important to close a file after it has been opened because it frees up system resources that were being used to keep the file open.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file in Python using the open() function, the operating system creates a file object that allows your program to read or write to the file. The file object uses system resources, such as memory and file descriptors, to maintain its connection to the file on disk. If you do not close the file object after you are done using it, these system resources will remain allocated to the file object, even though you are no longer using it. This can cause problems if you open many files in your program and do not close them, as you can run out of system resources and your program may crash.\n",

This means that the data is written from the system's memory cache to the physical storage on disk. If you do not close the file, there is a chance that some of the data you have written may not be saved to disk."
